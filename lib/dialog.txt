Once there was a very, very famous author named Vida Winter. However, no one knows about her personal life... not even her real name... You are Margaret Lea, a bookworm living in a bookstore. Vida Winter has selected you to write her biography. You must first make it to her residence (in one piece).
Vida Winter had always buried her problems. Whenever an interviewer asked about her past, s/he was given not the truth, but a story.
Winter has always hidden from her troubled past, the burden growing exponentially every time she covered it up.
Fear led Winter to procrastination, the weight increasing so much so that it became absolutely crucial that she come clean with the truth.
You guessed it! All the stress could've been avoided, had Winter faced her fears directly.
It only takes one moment to come clean, and never again will you feel the pressure of your troubles. However, hiding the problem requires one to continuously keep on digging oneself into a deeper and deeper hole. Relieving the distress of your problems is best accomplished by approaching them candidly, rather than covering them up.
